    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

    <p class="description">
        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the BRYB mobile application, website, and related services (collectively, the “Platform”). By accessing or using the Platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Platform.
    </p>

    <div class="block">
        <h2>1. About Us</h2>
        <p>
            The Platform is operated by Onhouse Technologies Private Limited, a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 2013, India (“Onhouse”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). <br />
            BRYB provides access to a Prepaid Payment Instrument (“PPI”) wallet, rewards, and related services in partnership with a licensed PPI issuer. The PPI wallet is issued and operated by Transcorp International Limited, an entity authorised by the Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) to issue PPIs. <br />
            Onhouse is not a bank and does not itself issue, hold, or manage wallet balances.

        <h2>3. Nature of Services</h2>

            BRYB enables users to:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Create and access a PPI wallet issued by Transcorp International Limited
                </li>
                <li>
                    Load funds into the wallet using supported payment methods
                </li>

                </li>
            </ul>
            All monetary value stored in the wallet is issued, held, and regulated solely by Transcorp International Limited.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
        <h2>4. Account registration & KYC</h2>
        <p>
            To access wallet services, you must provide accurate, complete, and up-to-date information and complete KYC verification as mandated by RBI regulations and Transcorp policies. <br />
            You are responsible for safeguarding your account credentials. All activity conducted through your account shall be deemed authorised by you.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="block">
        <h2>5. Fees & Charges</h2>
        <p>
            Certain services may attract fees, including but not limited to account setup fees, service fees, convenience fees, or feature-specific charges. All applicable fees will be disclosed on the Platform prior to confirmation. <br />
            Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all fees are non-refundable.
        </p>
    </div>


    <div class="block">
        <h2>6. Wallet Load Times, transaction & refunds</h2>
        <p>
            Wallet load and transaction processing times may vary depending on the payment method used, bank or network processing timelines, third-party service providers, and technical or regulatory factors beyond our control. While most wallet loads are processed in near real time, instant credit is not guaranteed. A wallet load shall be considered successful only when the amount is credited to the Prepaid Payment Instrument (PPI) wallet issued by Transcorp International Limited. <br />
            In cases where a transaction is debited from the user’s bank account but not credited to the wallet, or remains in a pending state, the transaction will be reconciled and reversed or completed in accordance with applicable banking, network, and RBI-prescribed settlement timelines. Onhouse Technologies Private Limited does not manually intervene in or control bank-side reversals or settlement timelines. <br />
            Successfully credited wallet balances are not refundable, except where required by applicable law or regulatory direction. Any refunds, where applicable, shall be processed in accordance with RBI guidelines, Transcorp policies, and the original mode of payment. Funds stored in the wallet do not earn interest, as per RBI regulations.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
        <h2>7. Wallet Usage & Restrictions</h2>
        <p>
            You agree not to use the Platform or wallet for any unlawful, fraudulent, or prohibited activities, including but not limited to money laundering, terrorist financing, or activities restricted under applicable laws or RBI guidelines. We reserve the right to restrict, suspend, or terminate wallet access in cases of suspected misuse, regulatory non-compliance, or risk to the Platform or its partners.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="block">
        <h2>8. Rewards & Promotions</h2>
        <p>
            Rewards, points, cashback, or promotional benefits offered on the Platform: <br />
            <ul>
                <li>Are promotional in nature and have no cash value unless expressly stated</li>
                <li>May be subject to eligibility criteria, caps, expiry, or modification</li>
